    "#### Variable Notes:\n",
    "AGE - This variable is right skewed with a range from age 21 to 79. The average age is 35 with the median at 34. This variable is clean of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bill Amount (BILL_AMT1_Sept - BILL_AMT6_April) - The amount of the credit card bill in Taiwan Dollar for the months April 2005 to September2015. The bill amounts across the months are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDUCATION - Undergraduate degree (University) is the most common education level at 46.8%. The majority of observations (82.1%) are from individuals with an undergraduate degree (University) or better.\n",
    "\n",
    "LIMIT_BAL - Ranges from 10k to 1mm with a median of 140k. The values are right skewed, however, no unreasonable looking outliers. The total credit limit extended to the sample is over five billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "MARRIAGE - Single makes up the largest group at 53.2%, then Married at 45.5%, and lastly an Others group of 1.3%\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay History (PAY_0_Sept - PAY_6_April) - The 3rd quartile for each month is zero meaning, most observations are zero or less. One month delays seem to be far more absent in months PAY_2_Aug to PAY_6_April, with PAY_5_May, PAY_6_April not having any at all and seems rather odd. Only PAY_0_Sept of 1 seems to fit as one would expect. As mentioned previously, the provided documentation does not explain the values of -2 and 0, but it can be inferred as not negative events. To resolve these problems, one solution would be to create a variable called **has_Pay_Delay** history and consolidate it to a binary TRUE/FALSE variable and, thereby, removing the month in which it occurred. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pay Amount (PAY_AMT1_Sept - PAY_AMT6_April) - Is the amount of the payment toward the credit card that month. About a fifth of the observations are zeros each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "SEX - Females are the majority gender at 60.4%.\n",
    "\n",
    "AGE_range - Variable was created by bracketing the ages from the AGE variable by 10 years ('21-30', '31-40', '41-50', '51-60', '61-70', '71-80+'). Seventy-two percent of the observations fall in to the first two categories \"21-30\" and \"31-40.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "default payment next month - This is a binary variable of 0 or 1. 22.1% of the obeservations were considered in default in October 2005 and this is the sample average.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
