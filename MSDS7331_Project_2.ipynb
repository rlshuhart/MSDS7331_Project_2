    "#### Variable Notes:\n",
    "AGE - This variable is right skewed with a range from age 21 to 79. The average age is 35 with the median at 34. This variable is clean of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bill Amount (BILL_AMT1_Sept - BILL_AMT6_April) - The amount of the credit card bill in Taiwan Dollar for the months April 2005 to September2015. The bill amounts across the months are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDUCATION - Undergraduate degree (University) is the most common education level at 46.8%. The majority of observations (82.1%) are from individuals with an undergraduate degree (University) or better.\n",
    "\n",
    "LIMIT_BAL - Ranges from 10k to 1mm with a median of 140k. The values are right skewed, however, no unreasonable looking outliers. The total credit limit extended to the sample is over five billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "MARRIAGE - Single makes up the largest group at 53.2%, then Married at 45.5%, and lastly an Others group of 1.3%\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay History (PAY_0_Sept - PAY_6_April) - The 3rd quartile for each month is zero meaning, most observations are zero or less. One month delays seem to be far more absent in months PAY_2_Aug to PAY_6_April, with PAY_5_May, PAY_6_April not having any at all and seems rather odd. Only PAY_0_Sept of 1 seems to fit as one would expect. As mentioned previously, the provided documentation does not explain the values of -2 and 0, but it can be inferred as not negative events. To resolve these problems, one solution would be to create a variable called **has_Pay_Delay** history and consolidate it to a binary TRUE/FALSE variable and, thereby, removing the month in which it occurred. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pay Amount (PAY_AMT1_Sept - PAY_AMT6_April) - Is the amount of the payment toward the credit card that month. About a fifth of the observations are zeros each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "SEX - Females are the majority gender at 60.4%.\n",
    "\n",
    "AGE_range - Variable was created by bracketing the ages from the AGE variable by 10 years ('21-30', '31-40', '41-50', '51-60', '61-70', '71-80+'). Seventy-two percent of the observations fall in to the first two categories \"21-30\" and \"31-40.\"\n",
    "\n",

To wrongly classify someone as to not default could lead to a large loss to the credit card company, whereas, incorrectly classifying someone as to default incorrect intervention might lead to a loss of a customer. Given the little domain knowledge of default intervention strategies, we are going to assume the cost of default of a customer is more than the cost of a lost customer. This means the false positives (FP) are not as costly as false negatives (FN). Furthermore, this means that the recall measurement should be maximized while minimizing the impact of precision.
